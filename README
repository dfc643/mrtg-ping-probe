mrtg-ping-probe is a ping probe for MRTG 2.x.  It is used to monitor
the round trip time and packet loss to networked devices.  MRTG uses
its output to generate graphs visualizing minimum and maximum round
trip times or packet loss.

The latest release of mrtg-ping-probe can always be found on the web at
	http://pwo.de/projects/mrtg/
or via anonymous ftp at
	ftp://ftp.pwo.de/pub/pwo/mrtg/mrtg-ping-probe/

mrtg-ping-probe depends on the following software being installed on
your system: perl (at least version 5.003), mrtg (I use version 2.8.8,
though any mrtg 2.x version should work), and a ping program that
displays a summary of the round trip times upon termination or
timeout.

mrtg-ping-probe runs on AIX, BSD/OS 2.1, FreeBSD/2.2.x, IRIX/6.2,
Linux, Mac OS X (Darwin 5.4), NetBSD, OpenBSD, OS/2, OSF1 V3.2, Solaris
1.1.2 (SunOS 4.1.4), Solaris 2.5.1 (SunOS 5.5.1), Solaris 7 (SunOS
5.7), Solaris 8 (SunOS 5.8), Solaris 9 (SunOS 5.9), HP-UX 9, Windows
98, and Windows 2000 (english, french, portugesee, and spanish
locales).

If you install the Windows ping program that comes with Windows 98,
Windows 2000, or WinSock 2.x, mrtg-ping-probe will also run on Windows
95 and Windows 4.0.

Support for additional systems is usually easy to add, as described in
the file INSTALL.

Act responsible: do not use mrtg-ping-probe to ping devices without the
owner's permission.  Just imagine 10,000 people would decide to ping
your hosts ...  mrtg-ping-probe is meant to be used within your network
to get round trip time performance figures for your network.


Please check out Tobias Oetiker's smokeping ("the mrtg for latency") at
	http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/smokeping/
SmokePing measures latency, latency distribution and packet loss in
your network. It uses RRDtool to maintain the longterm datastore and to
draws pretty graphs.


IMPORTANT!  Communicate any problem and suggested patches to me, Peter
W. Osel <pwo@pwo.de>, so we can keep this distribution in sync.  If
you have a problem, there will be someone else who had it or will have
it too...

If possible, send me patches such that the patch program will apply
them.  Context diffs are the best, then normal diffs.  Do not send ed
scripts, I have probably changed my copy since the version you got.


I have to thank the following people

Tobias Oetiker <oetiker@ee.ethz.ch> and Dave Rand <dlr@bungi.com> for
writing MRTG in the first place.

Wee-Meng LEE <leewm@sgp.hp.com> for porting mrtg-ping-probe to HPUX 9.x
and writing cfgpingmaker, which I renamed to mrtg-ping-cfg and plan to
rewrite it in perl as soon as I find the time (tm;-)

Simon Amor <simon@foobar.co.uk> for his perl script.  It was a big help
and motivation to get mrtg-ping-probe started.

Fabrizio Pivari <Fabrizio.Pivari@agip.it> for adding AIX support.

Mick Ghazey <mick@lowdown.com> for triggering the port to Linux.

Dobrica Pavlinusic <dpavlin@foi.hr> for adding OSF1 support.

Ray Goodrich <RGoodrich@aviant.com> for adding support for Windows.

Pavel Juran <juran@proca.cz> for valuable insights into the Windows
world and information on WinSock 2.x for Windows 95/98.

voytek@sbt.net.au for helping on the OS/2 port.

Ola Eriksson <ola@udd.net> for adding NetBSD support.

Xander Soldaat <xander@soldaat.com> for adding OpenBSD support.

Scott Shipley <SShipley@innovexinc.com> for adding RedHat 7 support.

Jerome Moinet <jerome@moinet.org> and Nicolas
<ndsoftware@ndsoftware.net> for helping to support the french Windows
locale, Luis Rafael <lrafael@ipg.pt> for helping with the portugesee
locale, and Luis Carrizo <luis-carrizo@ajvierci.com.py> for helping
with the spanish locale.

Peter "Pete" Chen <petechen@on2.com> for his timeout contribution.

Fred Inklaar <fred@airplant.net> for adding support for Mac OS X
(Darwin 5.4).

Thomas Sailer <sailer@gamecube.hb9jnx.ampr.org>, Ulf Viney
<uviney@blueairnetworks.com>, Enrique Iglesias Rodriguez
<enrique@intelideas.net>, Martin <anonymous@sol.dk>, and
<winniethepooh@libertysurf.fr> for helping to support RedHat Linux 7.3
(and possibly other new Linux distributions using new ping versions).

Willem Jan Withagen <wwithagen@vianetworks.nl> for pointing out that
freebsd 3.x and later no longer allows non-root user to use ping -s.
