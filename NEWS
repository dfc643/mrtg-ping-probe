2003-09-13	Release_2_2_0

	* new platforms supported: italian Windows locale.

	* ***** Possible Incompatibility ****
	raised minimum required perl version to 5.6.1.  Older
	perl versions might still work, but I am testing with
	5.6.1 and 5.8.0 only.

	* bugfix: the ping child process should actually be
	killed now on Unix platforms.

	* bugfix: on Windows actually return deadtime when
	we lost all packets, not 0.

	* lots of typos fixed in comments and messages.


2002-07-14	Release_2_1_0

	* new platforms supported: Mac OS X (Darwin 5.4), RedHat Linux
	7.3 (and possibly other newer Linux Distributions using newer
	version of the ping program), brazilian, colombian, and german
	Windows.

	* ***** Possible Incompatibility ****
	on freebsd > 3.x 'ping -s' is only allowed to be used by root.
	We no longer pass the packet size option to ping on freebsd,
	unless we run as root (which we shouldn't).


2001-01-21	Release_2_0_2

	* bugfix: failed to match ping summary on certain platforms
	(e.g. Linux) which included a mdev value.


2001-01-07	Release_2_0_1

	* bugfix: almost all platforms but Solaris were broken, fixed
	regular expressions to find round trip time and packet loss.

	* bugfix: test for existence of perl builtin alarm().  Perl on
	Windows usually does not have it, and thus we cannot timeout
	the perl command.


2001-01-06      Release_2_0_0

	* new platforms supported: NetBSD, OpenBSD, RedHat 7,
		french, portugesee, and spanish Windows 2000.

	* new feature: monitor packet loss, scale reported
		ping times by an integer factor, flexible
		selection of values to be monitored, option
		to suppress errors related to unreachable
		targets, option to select deadtime, option
		to select a timeout which aborts external
		ping program.

	* provide pgp signed md5 checksum files for tar/shar/zip
	archives to protect against trojan horses.


1999-01-01	Release_1_9_0

	* new feature: added option -o to mrtg-ping-probe to pass
	options to the ping program called.  Can e.g. be used to
	suppress address to hostname mapping which could cause the ping
	to fail if your DNS failed.  Thanx Andy Kniveton
	<kniveton@ecid.cig.mot.com> for the idea.

	* bugfix: the file "&1" is no longer created on Windows 95/98,
	(this also gets rid of the bogus error message 'Bad parameter 2').

	* rewrote README and INSTALL, which hopefully are more useful now.

	* detailed log of changes provided in file ChangeLog

	* list of tasks in file TODO
