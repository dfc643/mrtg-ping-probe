mrtg-ping-probe - A Round Trip Time and Packet Loss Probe

	MRTG - The Multi Router Traffic Grapher.

See the file COPYRIGHT in the distribution for the exact terms.

Please read the file README first.

Please make sure you have the latest release of mrtg-ping-probe.
Read the file README to find out where to get the latest release.


Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

- perl <http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html>
	I use version 5.003, but any later version will most likely
	work without any problem.

- MRTG	<http://ee-staff.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/mrtg/mrtg.html>
	I use version 2.8.8, but any 2.x version will most likely work
	without any problem.

- a ping program
	You need a ping program that displays a summary of the round
	trip times upon termination or timeout.  mrtg-ping-probe knows
	how to call the system's native ping program for supported
	systems (see the file README for a list).  See below for
	platform specific information and for information on adding
	support for a new system.


Check the script mrtg-ping-probe, and adapt the path to your perl if
necessary.  Put the script into a place where MRTG can call it, e.g.
the your MRTG binary directory.

Edit your mrtg.cfg file to add statements for the devices you want to
ping.  See mrtg.cfg-ping for an example.  You might also use and
customize the contributed script mrtg-ping-cfg to generate entries
suitable for your environment.

Optionally create the documentation in the format you like best, e.g.
	make html
	make man
	make tex


Platform specific notes:


* OS/2

- mrtg-ping-probe has been tested on OS/2 Warp4 with Perl 5.002
- mrtg-ping-probe "requires" perl 5.003 or better, you might need
	to change the line "require 5.003;" to "require 5.002;"
- the Target line in your mrtg.cfg needs to include perl5:
	Target[pwo.de.ping]: `perl5 mrtg-ping-probe pwo.de`
- depending on where you placed files, you might need to list
	the absolute pathname for mrtg-ping-probe.
- test mrtg-ping-probe with the commands
	perl5 mrtg-ping-probe -V
	perl5 mrtg-ping-probe pwo.de


* Solaris 2 and possibly others

- some ping programs try to map IP addresses to hostnames.  A ping
	can fail, if your DNS cannot resolve the address.  If you use
	IP addresses in mrtg.cfg and want to suppress IP address to
	hostname mapping, pass the appropriate ping option, using the
	new -o option.  E.g. on Solaris your Target[] declaration to
	ping the device at address 10.1.2.3 would look like this:

	Target[10.1.2.3]: `/usr/local/sbin/mrtg-ping-probe -o -n 10.1.2.3`


* Windows 95/98/NT 4.0/2000

- the native ping program on Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 do not
	display a summary of the round trip times upon termination or
	timeout.  You need to install a ping program that displays the
	summary information, e.g. the ping program of Windows 98 or
	Windows 2000.  You can also use WinSock 2.x (see:
	http://www.sockets.com/).
- the Target line in your mrtg.cfg might need to include the complete
	pathname to your perl executable and to the mrtg-ping-probe
	script:
	Target[pwo.de.ping]: `c:\perl5\perl c:\mrtg-2.5.2\mrtg-ping-probe pwo.de`
- make sure that the quotes in the Target line are "back-quotes" (aka
	accent-grave, back-ticks, or as one Windows user once described
	it:  "The ` is the one next to the 1 key and NOT the single
	quote below the double quote key." ;-)


* some Linux, and possibly other platforms.

- some ping programs won't stop until they received the configured
	number of ECHO_RESPONSE packets.  If your target is unreachable,
	these ping will just keep sending ECHO_RESPONSE packets, and
	mrtg-ping-probe might seem to hang.  In this case use the
	timeout option (-t timeout) to abort the ping after a reasonable
	time.

	You should configure a timeout, if the manual page of your ping
	mentions the phrase "(and receiving)" for the count option:

	-c count
	Stop after sending (and receiving) count ECHO_RESPONSE packets.


* FreeBSD

- on freebsd > 3.x 'ping -s' is only allowed to be used by root.  We no
	longer pass the packet size option to ping on freebsd, unless
	we run as root (which we shouldn't).


* Adding support for a new platform:

- make sure you have the latest release of mrtg-ping-probe (See the
	file README where to find it)
- make sure that the native ping program displays a summary of the
	round trip times upon termination or get and install a version
	that does so, e.g. ftp://ftp.nikhef.nl/pub/network/ping.tar.Z.
- determine perl's idea about your platform name:
	perl -e 'use Config; print $Config{"osname"}, "\n"'
- add a line to the %ping associative array for your platform, e.g.:
	'linux' =>	"/bin/ping -c $count -s $length $host",
	where 'linux' is the output of the above perl command,
	/bin/ping the absolute pathname of your ping program,
	also check the documentation to adapt the arguments to ping.
- test whether mrtg-ping-probe can find the summary information of your ping:
	mrtg-ping-probe some.host.name
	if you get the error message
		"ERROR: Could not find ping summary for some.host.name"
	you have to adapt the regular expression that matches the ping output
	in function ping().
- send context diffs of your changes to me, Peter W. Osel <pwo@pwo.de>,
	so we can keep this distribution in sync.
	Also send the following information:

	output of the command "uname -a"

	output of the command "man ping"

	output of the ping command when pinging some hosts ten times, e.g.
		ping some.host.name 56 10
		ping -c 10 some.host.name
	(The actual command arguments may be different)

	complete pathname of the native ping program, or if you use a
	non-native ping program, information on which ping you use.
