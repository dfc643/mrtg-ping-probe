2003-09-13	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* Release 2_2_0

	* mrtg-ping-probe, check-ping-fmt:
		added support italian Windows loacale with the help of
		Reale Marco <Marco.Reale@secondamano.it>

	* mrtg-ping-probe:
		on Windows actually return deadtime when we lost all
		packets, not 0.  When the Windows ping loses all
		packets (100% loss), it still returns a valid summary
		with a rtt of 0.  Now we detect this case and reset the
		rtt to the given deadtime, so the expected value is
		returned.  bug reported by "Russ Grotewold"
		<rgrotewold@adlercomputing.com>


2003-02-23	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* ChangeLog, mrtg-ping-probe:
		fixed spelling errors as pointed out by Francois
		Wolmarans <fwo@obsidian.co.za> and by ispell(1).

	* mrtg-ping-probe:
		fixed killing of child process, the first argument of
		the perl kill function has to be the signal.  Reported
		by Wilfried Gaensheimer <wig@Micronas.com>.

		raised minimum version of perl supported to 5.6.1

		default to use /bin/perl and not /usr/local/bin/perl

		initialize ping_output variable to empty string.

	* extended copyright to current year


2002-07-14	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* Release 2_1_0

	* mrtg-ping-probe, check-ping-fmt:
		added support for Mac OS X (Darwin 5.4), with the help
		of Fred Inklaar <fred@airplant.net>.

		added support for RedHat Linux 7.3 (and possibly other
		new Linux distributions using new ping versions), with
		the help of
		Thomas Sailer <sailer@gamecube.hb9jnx.ampr.org>,
		Ulf Viney <uviney@blueairnetworks.com>,
		Enrique Iglesias Rodriguez <enrique@intelideas.net>,
		Martin <anonymous@sol.dk>,
		and <winniethepooh@libertysurf.fr>.

		added support for parsing the windows ping output in
		different locales:
		brazilian
			with the help of
			Marcio Queiroz <marcioqueiroz@vicom.com.br>
		colombian
			with the help of
			Victor Maldonado <Victor.Maldonado@intesa.com.co>
		german
			with the help of <root@solariz.de> and
			Harald Reisinger" <h.reisinger@base-camp.cc>

	* mrtg-ping-probe, INSTALL:
		***** Possible Incompatibility *****
		on freebsd > 3.x 'ping -s' is only allowed to be used
		by root.  We no longer pass the packet size option to
		ping on freebsd, unless we run as root (which we
		shouldn't).  Pointed out by Willem Jan Withagen
		<wwithagen@vianetworks.nl>.

	* check-ping-fmt:
		added copyright message

	* extended copyright to current year, changed my mail address
		from pwo@guug.de to pwo@pwo.de.

	* README:
		added link to smokeping, the mrtg of latency monitoring


2001-01-21	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* Release 2_0_2


2001-01-08	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* mrtg-ping-probe:
		further fine tuning and simplifying the regular
		expressions to match ping's output on FreeBSD 4.x,
		RedHat 6.x, and Solaris 7 with the help of David
		Richardson <dlr@rhinointernet.com> and James Eborall
		<james.eborall@mci.co.uk>.


2001-01-07	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* Release 2_0_1

	* mrtg-ping-probe:
		verify that alarm() function exists.  I have not found
		a perl distribution that implements the alarm() built-in
		function on Win32.  It seems that you cannot timeout on
		most blocking system calls on Win32.  Blame Microsoft ;-).

		fixed regular expressions for round trip time and
		packet loss summaries.  Almost all but Solaris did no
		longer match.

2001-01-06	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* Release 2_0_0

	* Makefile: added initial support to generate pgp signed md5
	checksum files for tar/shar/zip archives to protect against
	trojan horses.

2001-01-02	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* mrtg-ping-probe:
		The pick-list now allows to multiply the ping returned
		value by an integer factor (e.g. to multiply by 1000 to
		graph LAN ping times smaller than a millisecond with
		pings returning fractions of a millisecond).

		Introduced the -D debug option to control the insanity
		increase imposed on me programming mrtg-ping-probe.

	* mrtg-ping-probe, check-ping-fmt:
		match and pass fractional ping times all the way up,
		convert to integer after multiplying with the given
		factor, just before we print the values

		merged regular expressions of different windows locales
		together, probably catching more locales now.


2001-01-01	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* mrtg-ping-probe:

		added support for RedHat 7, with the help of Scott
		Shipley <SShipley@innovexinc.com>.  RedHat 7 prints
		"mdev" instead of "stddev".

	* mrtg-ping-probe, check-ping-fmt:

		added support for parsing the windows ping output in
		different locales:
		french
			contributed by Jerome Moinet
			<jerome@moinet.org>,
			with the help of Nicolas
			<ndsoftware@ndsoftware.net>
		portugesee
			with the help of Luis Rafael <lrafael@ipg.pt>
		spanish
			with the help of Luis Carrizo
			<luis-carrizo@ajvierci.com.py>


2000-09-03	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* mrtg-ping-probe:
		added timeout option to abort external ping programs
		that seem to hang (i.e. wait to _receive_ the given
		number of ECHO_RESPONSE packets, instead of just
		sending them;  if your target is unreachable, these
		pings ping forever ...); based on a contribution by
		Peter "Pete" Chen <petechen@on2.com>.

		added option to set deadtime (the value we return when
		we assume that the target is unreachable).

		added option -s (silent mode) to suppress error messages
		in case the ping times out or the target is unreachable.

		added option -p (pick/print) to select which values to
		print.  valid arguments are: min/max/avg/loss/number.
		Finally we have support to graph packet loss ;-)

		new function check_numeric() to check numeric arguments

		prepared for adding internal, perl based ping.

		do not setup redirection for OS/2.  OS/2 does like
		stderr redirection we use in Unix (2>&1), but Perl
		tries to be "smart" about when to run a command
		directly and when to run it via the shell.  Presumably
		it gets it wrong in this case.  pointed out by Voytek
		Eymont <voytek@sbt.net.au>

		added support for OpenBSD, contributed by Xander
		Soldaat <xander@soldaat.com>

	* mrtg.cfg-ping: added example for new Packet Loss monitoring.


	* INSTALL: extended copyright to current year, updated URLs for
		software, added hint when to configure a timeout option.

	* README: updated URLs for software


	* mrtg-ping-probe, README: extended copyright to current year,
		added support for NetBSD (contributed by Ola Eriksson
		<ola@udd.net>).


2000-01-29	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* COPYRIGHT: restricted copyright to version 2 of the GNU
		General Public License


1999-01-01	Peter W. Osel	<pwo@pwo.de>

	* mrtg-ping-probe: new option -o to pass options to the
	ping program called.

	* changed RCS keywords to include SCCS magic string @(#) such
	that the SCCS what(1) command displays them.

	* COPYRIGHT, README, check-ping-fmt, mrtg-ping-probe,
	mrtg-ping-success-probe: extended copyright to current year.

	* README: described where to find the latest release.  Added
	hint to act responsible.

	* README, INSTALL: general cleanup, moved parts back and forth
	between these two files, to a hopefully more logical split.

	* NEWS: changed date format from yyyy/mm/dd to yyyy-mm-dd

	* mrtg-ping-probe: do not redirect stderr for MSWin32;  Windows
	95/98 do not support this - they create the file '&1' and print
	an error message 'Bad parameter 2'.  Windows NT does support
	stderr redirection, but the ping programs don't print anything
	to stderr.  So why bother ;-).  Fix provided by Pavel Juran
	<juran@proca.cz>.

	* ChangeLog: new file to log changes in great details
